/*
You have a water dispenser that can dispense cold, warm, and hot water. Every second, you can either fill up 2 cups with different types of water, or 1 cup of any type of
water.You are given a 0-indexed integer array amount of length 3 where amount[0], amount[1], and amount[2] denote the number of cold, warm, and hot water cups you need to
fill respectively. Return the minimum number of seconds needed to fill up all the cups.
Input: amount = [1,4,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: One way to fill up the cups is:
Second 1: Fill up a cold cup and a warm cup.
Second 2: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 3: Fill up a warm cup and a hot cup.
Second 4: Fill up a warm cup.
It can be proven that 4 is the minimum number of seconds needed.
